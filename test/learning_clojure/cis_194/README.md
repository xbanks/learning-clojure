Problems from UPENN's CIS 194 Intro to Haskell Course
=====================================================

I've used this class in the past to prepare for a Programming Languages course at my University, it deals with functional programming in Haskell, which I really enjoyed. This was a great precursor, and a big help towards me getting a 99 in that class ;)

In this folder I will be going through some of the homework given in that course.

[I definitely reccomend it if you want to learn Haskell/Functional Programming](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/)

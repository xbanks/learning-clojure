# learning-clojure

This is my foray into learning clojure. I've wanted to try learning at least one of each type of programming language, whether it be a scripting language, an OOP language, etc... Plus I just like learning languages in general.
My list so far is as follows:
   - OOP -> Java/C++ for work
   - Functional -> Haskell/Scala
   - Lispy -> Now Clojure
   - Scripting -> PowerShell, Ruby, Python

By no means am I an expert in these, I'm more or less trying to get an idea of how all of them work and find the ones that I like the most. Right now, that's _[Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/)_, it's mix of OOP and Functional styles are great for me.

I'll try to put notes on what I'm learning throughout the comments in the code to keep track of my learning. Hopefully others can benefit from it too.

If you have any suggestions on my programming style or what I may be doing wrong, or any knowledge you wish to share about clojure, I'd happily accept it!
